# VendingMachine
### Course: EE 2469, Lab Section: EE 2169
### Date: 4/30/15

This lab was the final lab assignment for the EE 2469 Lab. For this lab we were to implement a Burrito Vending Machine with the motivation that the University was going to install the vending machines around campus. We were to implement this using a hardware-descriptive language, Verilog, and be able to run this on an FPGA board, specifically the NI-EVLIS. I wrote and tested this off-campus on a similar but smaller FPGA board, the BASYS2, as we were unable to take the NI_ELVIS from the lab. Along with the Verilog module and corresponding UCF, we were to document the design using an algorithmic state machine.
